## Business Problem ðŸŽ¯

City Hotels and Resort Hotels have observed high cancellation rates, resulting in:

- Lower revenues
- Suboptimal room utilization

### Objective
To identify the factors driving cancellations and provide actionable business advice to reduce cancellation rates and enhance hotel revenue generation.

## Assumptions

- No unusual events between 2015 and 2017 significantly affected the data.
- The data reflects current trends and is applicable for future planning.
- Recommendations have not been previously implemented by the hotels.
- Cancellations leave rooms vacant for the booked duration.
- Customers generally cancel within the same year they booked.

## Research Questions

1. What factors influence hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can hotels minimize cancellations?
3. How can data insights guide hotels in pricing and promotional strategies?

## Hypotheses

- Higher prices lead to increased cancellations.
- A longer waiting list correlates with a higher cancellation rate.
- Most clients book through offline travel agents.
